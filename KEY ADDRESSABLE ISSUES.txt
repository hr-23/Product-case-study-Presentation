Throughput Rate for each Equipment
• Throughput rate of Reactor
(R1) is the lowest
• Thus, R1 proves to be a
bottleneck in the
manufacturing process
• PVC production capacity per
day is lower than expected
• Scrapped Toys are sold at average INR 50, despite cost of toys amounting to
approximately INR 350
• Company only uses Retail Channel for sales, highly limiting their revenue increasing options
Bhubaneshwar has highest packaging cost, highest error rate &
lowest efficiency, still it receives highest yearly PVC shipment
increasing final cost
• Packaging cost, error rate & taxes of every toy manufacturing plant vary
• Despite this, all the plants run at similar capacity utilization of 60%. This increase the cost of
the final product
• Transportation cost rising as no Optimum route from Toy manufacturing plant to distribution
center has been found
• Employee attrition is high, due to hectic working schedule resulting in increased
costs of hiring and training new joiners
